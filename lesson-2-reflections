* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository it creates a .git folder. At this point there are no commmits. However git starts storing metadata about the project an creates the boilerplate for that. Once we do git commit the file we mark to track will get saved into the git system.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediete area which is more like an intend to commit. Although git has started maintaining information about chaanges it hasnt recorded anything at that point. The working directory contains all files but the history is maintained by git. The working directory only contains the view we would like to see currently, while the repository contains all the snapshots. The benefit it offers is that it is great when you would like to commit half the files not all of the files in the directory or when you would like to stage changes but wait for some form of go ahead to commit, like an approval or others
